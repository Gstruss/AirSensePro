# AirSensePro

Welcome,

We are pleased to present our Integrative Project formed by Danna Beltr치n, Daniel L칩pez, Dilan P치ez, Jahaira Palencia, and Geoffrey Struss.

The purpose of our project is to develop a web platform that provides users with real-time information about air pollutants and weather information in the city of Bogot치, using the user's location to focus the information accurately.

We hope you enjoy our work and find the information we offer helpful.
